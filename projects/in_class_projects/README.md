Welcome to the In-Class Projects directory! Here, you'll find projects that were created and worked on during our classes. These projects serve as oriented tasks to help students grasp key concepts and apply them practically.

Each project will have its own folder with relevant files and a brief description. Feel free to explore and use these projects as references for your own work.
