Welcome to the Student Projects directory! This space is dedicated to showcasing the projects initiated and developed by our students. These projects reflect the creativity, dedication, and application of concepts learned during the course.

If you're a student looking to contribute your project:

- Ensure your project is well-documented.
- Create a new folder with your project name.
- Include a brief README in your folder describing your project, its objectives, and how to run it.

Feel free to explore the projects here and get inspired! =)
